# System Patterns

The platform employs a decentralized architecture leveraging the Solana blockchain for secure transactions and consensus-based verification. The system is built using the following key patterns:

## Frontend Patterns

- Component-based architecture using React and TypeScript
- Custom hooks pattern for reusable logic (useToast, useWalletConnection)
- Context providers for global state management
- Lazy loading pattern for optimized performance
- Event-driven UI updates for real-time feedback

## Backend Patterns

- Microservices architecture with distinct services:
  - User Management Service
  - Video Processing Service
  - Bet Settlement Service
  - Notification Service
- Event-driven communication using NATS message broker
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- CQRS pattern for separate read/write operations

## Data Management Patterns

- Decentralized storage using IPFS for videos
- PostgreSQL for structured data with proper indexing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Event sourcing for transaction history

## Security Patterns

- JWT-based authentication
- Zero-trust architecture
- Rate limiting and request validation
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

These patterns ensure scalability, security, and efficient decentralized data management while maintaining system reliability and performance.
