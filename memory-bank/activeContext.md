# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The development team is actively working on the decentralized video labeling and verification platform, with several key areas of focus:

### Completed Features

- Frontend UI prototype with swipe interface
- Initial Solana wallet integration
- Basic user authentication flow
- Consensus-based label verification system
- Bet placement and settlement logic
- Core user dashboard components

### In Progress

1. Enhancing video storage and retrieval via IPFS:

   - Implementing efficient video upload
   - Optimizing retrieval performance
   - Managing metadata storage

2. Expanding quality validation system:

   - Refining consensus algorithms
   - Implementing reputation scoring
   - Building validation dashboards

3. Scaling microservices:
   - Optimizing service communication
   - Implementing load balancing
   - Enhancing error handling

### Next Steps
