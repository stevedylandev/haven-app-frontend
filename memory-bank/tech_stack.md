# Technology Stack Overview

This document outlines the major technologies used in the project and provides an overview of the tools and frameworks that form both the frontend and backend ecosystems.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

- **Framework:** React with Vite for a fast development experience.
- **Language:** TypeScript for enhanced type safety and code quality.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **State Management:** React hooks and Context API for managing component state and global data.
- **Testing:** React Testing Library and Jest for robust unit and integration testing.

## 2. Backend Technologies

- **Framework:** NestJS for a scalable, modular, and maintainable server architecture.
- **Communication:** NATS for high-performance, asynchronous messaging between microservices.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable, relational data management.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Solana wallet integration for secure registration, transaction signing, and data authenticity.
- **Messaging:** Microservice event handling via NATS ensures decoupled and resilient service interactions.

## 3. Microservices Architecture

- **Service Design:** The backend is partitioned into specialized microservices, including:
  - User Management Service
  - Video Processing Service
  - Bet Settlement Service
  - Notification Service
- **API Gateway:** Routes external requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Inter-service Communication:** Achieved through asynchronous events and RPC-style messaging using NATS.

## 4. DevOps and CI/CD

- **Containerization:** Docker is used to containerize services for consistency across environments.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (planned for future enhancements) for deployment and scaling.
- **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions (or similar CI tools) drive automated testing, builds, and deployments.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are used for system monitoring, alongside centralized logging for troubleshooting.

## 5. Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption:** End-to-end encryption is implemented for all data transmissions.
- **Key Management:** Secure storage and management for database credentials and blockchain keys.
- **Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to protect both frontend and backend resources.

## 6. Additional Tools and Utilities

- **Code Quality:** ESLint and Prettier ensure consistent coding standards and formatting.
- **Version Control:** Git is utilized for source code management and collaborative development.
- **Package Management:** npm or yarn is used to manage project dependencies.
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode) powers local development with integrated debugging and extensions.
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit testing and Supertest for API testing to ensure service reliability.
- **Documentation:** Markdown is used for comprehensive project documentation.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **Scalability:** Explore serverless architectures and further decoupled microservice designs.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Integration of real-time monitoring, performance analytics, and logging enhancements.
- **Security Hardening:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, and updates to access control mechanisms.

## Conclusion

This tech stack is selected to build a modern, scalable, and secure application. It provides a robust foundation for both current requirements and future growth.
