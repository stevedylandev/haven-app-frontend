# Frontend Guidelines

## 1. Overview

This document outlines best practices and guidelines for frontend development in this project, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and a high-quality user experience.

## 2. Project Structure

- The project follows a modular structure with separation of concerns.
- Key directories:
  - `src/` contains the main application logic.
  - `src/components/` holds reusable UI components.
  - `src/hooks/` includes custom hooks for state management and side effects.
  - `src/utils/` comprises utility functions.
  - `src/context/` contains context providers for global state.

## 3. UI/UX Principles

- Consistent layout and design across all views.
- Responsive design implemented via Tailwind CSS.
- Clear, intuitive navigation with a swipe left/right interface for video clip browsing.
- Focus on usability and accessibility across components.

## 4. Component Design

- Components should be stateless where possible.
- Reusable components are stored in `src/components/`.
- Use descriptive naming and ensure separation between container and presentation components.
- Optimize performance by lazy loading components (e.g., components in `src/components/lazy/`).

## 5. State Management and Hooks

- Utilize React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for state management.
- Custom hooks, such as `useToast` and `useWalletConnection`, encapsulate common functionality.
- Use context providers to manage and propagate global state.
- Keep UI state in sync with backend data.

## 6. Styling and Theming

- Styling is powered by Tailwind CSS.
- Adhere to the design token guidelines (colors, spacing, fonts) defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS to maintain consistency throughout the project.

## 7. Code Quality and Best Practices

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistent code formatting.
- Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety.
- Write clear, modular, and maintainable code.
- Include comprehensive comments and documentation to assist future developers.

## 8. Performance Optimization

- Implement code-splitting and lazy loading for heavy or non-critical components.
- Minimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
- Optimize media assets (images, videos) for faster load times.

## 9. Accessibility

- Ensure all components are accessible (use ARIA labels and keyboard navigation).
- Regularly test accessibility using appropriate tools.
- Maintain suitable color contrast and legible font sizes for an inclusive user experience.

## 10. Testing and Debugging

- Write unit and integration tests for key components using React Testing Library and Jest.
- Leverage custom hooks for tracking user interactions and displaying notifications (e.g., using `useToast`).
- Continuously debug and refine components based on test outcomes.

## 11. Future Enhancements

- Update UI components regularly based on user feedback.
- Refine animations and transitions to enhance user engagement.
- Consider advanced state management solutions if the application complexity increases.

## 12. Conclusion

These guidelines are designed to ensure a consistent, performant, and maintainable frontend codebase. They should be reviewed and updated as the project evolves.
